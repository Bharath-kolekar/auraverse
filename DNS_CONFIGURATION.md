## ‚úÖ Verification Process

### **Check DNS Propagation**
Use these tools to verify DNS propagation:
- **whatsmydns.net**: Check global DNS propagation
- **dnschecker.org**: Verify DNS records worldwide
- **nslookup**: Command-line DNS lookup

### **Expected Results**
- `cognomega.com` should resolve to Replit's IP address
- `www.cognomega.com` should resolve via CNAME to cognomega.com
- Both domains should serve your application over HTTPS

### **Troubleshooting**
- **DNS not propagating**: Wait up to 48 hours for full propagation
- **SSL certificate issues**: May take additional time after DNS verification
- **404 errors**: Ensure deployment is active and domain is verified in Replit
- **Redirect loops**: Check for conflicting CNAME records

## üöÄ Post-Configuration

### **SEO Benefits**
- **Canonical URLs**: Both domains will serve the same content
- **HTTPS Redirect**: Automatic SSL encryption for security
- **WWW Preference**: Choose primary domain for consistency
- **Search Engine Indexing**: Better visibility with proper domain setup

### **User Experience**
- **Accessibility**: Users can reach your site via both URLs
- **Branding**: Professional appearance with custom domain
- **Trust**: HTTPS encryption builds user confidence
- **Performance**: Optimized delivery through Replit's infrastructure

### **Analytics Setup**
After DNS verification, configure:
- **Google Analytics**: Track traffic from both domains
- **Search Console**: Verify both domain versions
- **Social Media**: Update links to use primary domain
- **Marketing Materials**: Use canonical domain (cognomega.com)

## üìä Expected Timeline

### **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**
- DNS records added to registrar
- Replit deployment verification begins

### **Quick Propagation (5-30 minutes)**
- Primary DNS servers update
- Basic domain resolution works

### **Full Propagation (2-48 hours)**
- Global DNS propagation complete
- SSL certificates fully active
- All features operational

## üéØ Success Verification

### **Test Both Domains**
1. **https://cognomega.com** - Should load your application
2. **https://www.cognomega.com** - Should load your application
3. **http://cognomega.com** - Should redirect to HTTPS
4. **http://www.cognomega.com** - Should redirect to HTTPS
