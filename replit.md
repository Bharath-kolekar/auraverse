# Overview

This is a full-stack web application called "Infinite Intelligence" that provides AI-powered content creation tools. The platform allows users to generate audio, video, VFX, and images using artificial intelligence, with features like voice command controls and a marketplace for sharing/selling content. Built with a modern React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM. The application is designed for deployment on the user's custom domain cognomega.com.
