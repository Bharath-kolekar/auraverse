# Overview

"Infinite Intelligence" is a full-stack web application designed as a production-ready AI Intelligence Gateway. It provides unified access to various levels of AI capabilities through an interactive UI/UX, featuring GPU-accelerated local processing via WebGL and WebGPU. The platform incorporates a comprehensive monetization model with dynamic pricing optimization and a pay-per-intelligence credit system targeting high profit margins. It includes fully functional implementations for audio, video, VFX, and image generation with real-time processing. Video generation creates animated content with multiple frames (up to 150 frames at 30fps), though some debug logging issues persist. All code is production-grade, incorporating robust error handling, caching, and performance optimizations. The business vision is to provide professional quality content generation with end-to-end automation, ensuring global accessibility and market penetration through localized pricing, multi-currency support, and cultural adaptation.

## Known Issues (Pending)
- Video generation debug logs still appearing in console (functional but needs cleanup)
- Application refresh taking 300-500ms (needs optimization)
- Achievement sharing limited to text/URL only (needs server-side image generation for social media)
